# No-as-a-Service Frontend

A React + Vite frontend for the No-as-a-Service API that displays random rejection reasons.

## Features

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Make sure the backend API is running:**
   ```bash
   # In the parent directory
   npm start
   ```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` and will proxy API requests to the backend running on `http://localhost:3000`.

}
```
